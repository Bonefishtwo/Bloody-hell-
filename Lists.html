<h1> First on the list of lists:</h1>
<br>
	<p> This is a site that is visually attractive, the selection buttons are themed in a manner that allows you to navigate the website with ease rather than those that are an offence to your eyes. With that in mind, <a href="http://www.craiyon.com/search/evocative%20manga%20art%20with%20fanatical%20elements%20and%20intricate%20line%20work"> Contrast </a></p>
	
	<br>
		<H2> Second website in the list:</h2>
		<br>
			<P> This next site can get you hooked playing with their use of <a href="http://www.slotomania.com/new/"> repetition </a> and ever so happy themed ways.</p>
			<br>
				<h3> This is the third one: </h3>
				<br>
<p> <a href="https://www.autozone.com/">Proximity </a> is the next one on the list of lists and i believe it has all the parts for the job.</p>
<br>
	<p> the final fourth is really not hard to figure out. Any website that you search for or inquire about uses one major search engine over noste others and it's pretty much got the design style of  <a href="https://www.google.com/">alignment </a> </p>
